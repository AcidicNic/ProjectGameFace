## Install apk directly to your device via a browser

*TODO*

* essentially, just going to start releasing apks via github or i'll make a lil website idk yet. 3rd party apks can be installed from a browser if the user downloads the apks and enables "Install unknown apps" for that browser app. no developer mode or computer required.
